# Windows 95 Style Interactive Portfolio

![Portfolio Screenshot](assets/images/screenshot/Screenshot.png) 

Welcome to my personal portfolio, designed to look and feel like the classic Windows 95 operating system. This project was built from scratch to create a unique and memorable user experience that showcases my projects, certifications, and skills in an interactive desktop environment.

## üí° Project Goals

The primary goal was to step away from traditional, templated portfolios and build something that was not only functional but also demonstrated a deep understanding of JavaScript DOM manipulation, event handling, and core CSS layout principles. It was a fun challenge to replicate the behavior of a desktop OS within the constraints of a web browser.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Retro Win95 UI**: A faithful recreation of the classic desktop, taskbar, start menu, and window elements using the [98.css](https://jdan.github.io/98.css/) library and custom styling.
* **Interactive Desktop Environment**: Open applications, move windows, and interact with the interface just like a real OS.
* **Draggable & Resizable Windows**: All windows, including "About Me," "Projects," and "Certificates," can be dragged around the desktop and resized.
* **Dynamic Content**: Project, certificate, and contact information is loaded dynamically from a single `portfolioData.json` file.
* **Built-in "Applications"**: Includes several fun, interactive apps:
    * A fully functional **Snake** game üêç
    * A simple **Paint** program üé®
    * A simulated **MS-DOS** command prompt that recognizes commands.
* **Easter Eggs**: Explore the desktop to find hidden surprises!

* **Frontend**: JavaScript (ES6), HTML5, CSS3
* **Data Handling**: JSON for dynamically loading content.
* **Styling**: A combination of custom CSS and the [98.css](https://jdan.github.io/98.css/) library for the retro aesthetic.
