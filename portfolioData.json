    "intro": "Hi! I am Kavyansh Garg",
    "bio": "I am an aspiring Cyber Security Analyst and a Computer Application student, holding a Google Cyber Security Certificate. My core passion lies in solving complex, 'mind-boggling' problems, which led me from programming in Python and Bash to the intricate world of digital defense.I am particularly fascinated by the intersection of cybersecurity and artificial intelligenceâ€”exploring how AI can be leveraged for proactive threat detection and automated incident response, as well as understanding the unique challenges of securing AI systems themselves. With a strong foundation in security principles, hands-on programming skills, and a relentless curiosity, I am seeking a remote internship where I can contribute to a forward-thinking team and apply my analytical abilities to the evolving challenges of the AI-driven security landscape.",
